# ðŸ§© FMX Taskbar Fix (Windows)

Fixes the long-standing **FireMonkey (FMX)** issue where:
- Two taskbar icons appear (`TFMAppClass` + main form)
- Minimize / restore animations don't play correctly
- App hides completely when minimized

---

## âœ… Solution

The fix detaches the hidden `TFMAppClass` host window and promotes the visible form as the true app window, preserving proper **DWM minimize/restore animation** and **single taskbar integration**.

See [`FMX.TaskbarFix.Win`](./FMX.TaskbarFix.Win.pas) for the implementation.

end;
```

ðŸš€ My Pre-Release here try to Fix the FMX Taskbar behaviors on Windows
---
For years, FMX apps on Windows have suffered from a strange behavior â€” that mysterious extra taskbar icon or the missing animation when minimizing the main window.

After some deep digging, I found the real secret:  

In VCL, everything revolves around the TApplication object.
But in FMX, Windows uses a hidden internal form called TFMAppClass, which silently acts as the host and owner of your main form.

The twist?
This hidden window interferes with proper taskbar registration and DWM animations.

My pre-release fix isolates and detaches that host form safely, restoring native minimize/restore animations, single taskbar behavior, and full control â€” without closing or breaking the app!

Stay tuned â€” code and details coming soon ðŸ‘‡
